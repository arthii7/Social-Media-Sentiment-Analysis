# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis
Social Media Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview:
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of social media data, aiming to understand the emotions and opinions expressed by users on various platforms. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we analyze text data from sources like Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit to extract insights about public sentiment towards specific topics, brands, or events.

Key Features:
Data Collection: Utilizes APIs and web scraping techniques to gather social media data relevant to the analysis.
Preprocessing: Cleansing and preprocessing of text data, including tokenization, stemming, and removing stopwords to prepare it for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis Algorithms: Implements machine learning and deep learning models for sentiment classification, including techniques like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
